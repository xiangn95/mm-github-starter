Hi! Thank you for reading my post. I am Ng Xiang Yao, an enthusiast in Deep Learning and Computer Vision research. My goal in this blog is to post my thoughts in my research on Facial Anti-Spoofing as well as other interesting applications that Deep Learning will be able to search. Looking forward to progress myself academically and professionally along the way. 

Currently, I am still in a limbo of setting my own research direction for my Master's thesis. As of now, I am still in the middle of thinking about the possible directions that I may pursue in accordance to my own research lab under the supervision of my supervisor. I have read papers extensively in the field of Face Anti-Spoofing, but due to some difficulties, little progress can be made. Hence, I am also thinking of venturing into other fields such as Dual Pixel, 3D reconstruction, human expression recognition, image super-resolution etc.  

<!-- You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
